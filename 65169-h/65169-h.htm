<p>The cultures of Early Man in the Southwest, though yet imperfectly
known, seem most readily distinguishable by characteristic
types of projectile points. The majority of finds, and they
are rare, have been made on the surface; much less often at camp
or kill sites.</p>
<p>Camp sites were situated on ridges, in sand dunes, or on hills
overlooking streams, lakes, or ponds. Occupational features generally
include hearths, split and charred food bones, debris from
stone tool manufacturing, and a full inventory of stone tools.
Seeds, grinding stones, storage and cooking pits are rarely found
at such early sites.</p>
<p>Kill sites, by contrast, are usually situated on the edges of
streams, lakes, or ponds. Features will include animal skeletons,
sometimes partially dismembered, points used in killing game,
some stone butchering tools such as scrapers, knives, utilized flakes,
and waste flakes resulting from the sharpening of stone tools.
Preferred parts of game may be missing, indicating they were
carried back to camp. Hearths are occasionally found at kill sites,
indicating that part of the game may have been prepared there.</p>
<p>Points used by Early Man were likely thrown at game with
a spear-thrower or atl-atl, rather than shot at them with a bow
and arrow. Atl-atls were probably of wood, and had a long groove
on one side. Into this groove was placed the spear with a point
hafted onto one end. The atl-atl was thrust back and thrown
forward, releasing the spear on the forward thrust.</p>
<p>On the basis of findings, archaeologists have reconstructed two
widespread methods of hunting by Early Man. In the first instance,
game was observed, stalked and killed at watering places.
In the second, game was driven into an arroyo, stream, lake, or
pond, or stampeded over a cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">EARLY MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES</span></h2>
<p>It is a curious fact that Early Southwestern Man most often
made his tools of very finely textured stone. Perhaps this custom
was induced by the exacting, finely controlled technologies of
stone flaking practiced and the kinds of tools made. Indeed,
workmanship on many projectile points, knives, and scrapers is so
well achieved that one is led to believe that Early Man strove to
express some degree of esthetic idealism in his tools.</p>
<p>Demands in technology often led to the widespread trading of
choice materials. The best known of these is from the alibates
quarries near Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Fine quality
flint from this locality has been found at Early Man sites as far
west as Arizona and as far north as Wyoming and Montana.</p>
<p>Early man prepared point &ldquo;blanks&rdquo; by the striking of suitable
primary flakes by direct percussion from a block of stone, the
core. The striker consisted either of a hard subround hammerstone,
or a cylinder-hammer of soft stone, bone, antler, or hard
wood. Flakes driven off by the former were usually thicker at
one end. Those produced in the second instance were relatively
thin throughout their length. Long flakes or &ldquo;blades&rdquo; were also
often used as blanks, especially in the making of long projectile
points. They could be detached from cores with either of the
above strikers, or by holding a bone or stone &ldquo;punch&rdquo; on an edge
of a core and striking the top of the punch with a hammerstone.
This is a form of indirect percussion. Blades were also produced
by what has been called impulsive pressure. A bone, antler, or
stone-tipped crutch was applied to an edge of a core, and pressed
downwards with the chest, driving off a blade.</p>
<p>Often cores were pre-shaped before the striking or pressing
off of flakes or blades by what is termed the &ldquo;Levallois technique.&rdquo;
A block of stone was initially trimmed on both faces into a
round, oval, or triangular shape. Either one or a series of flakes
or blades were then driven off one or both faces of the core,
using any of the above percussion or pressure instruments. A
distinct advantage to the technique was that the upper face of
the detached flake or blade blanks had already been trimmed in
the process of initial preparation of the core. This same preparation
also predetermined to a large extent the shape of blanks produced
in the Levallois technique.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>The processes by which appropriate blanks were turned into
finished projectile points involved several manufacturing stages
and one or a combination of flaking techniques. The techniques
employed consisted of direct or indirect percussion, using a
hammerstone, cylinder-hammer, or punch, and direct or indirect
pressure, using a crutch, an animal claw or tooth, the edge of a length
of bone, antler, or stone.</p>
<p>The principal manufacturing stages include: 1) over-all initial
shaping by the careful thinning of both faces of the blank; 2)
secondary trimming of lateral and basal edges, including eventual
fluting; and 3) smoothing by grinding of lateral and basal edges.</p>
<p>As will later be seen in the descriptions, special kinds of initial
flaking, or facial thinning, are often characteristically associated
with certain Early Man points. On some, flaking may conform to
traditional patterns, while on others it may be irregular. The
following kinds of initial flake scars are distinguished:</p>
<p><i>Irregular</i>: flake scars are of irregular shape, and they are in no
particular alignment to one another or the point long-axis.</p>
<p><i>Transverse</i>: long, parallel flake scars are horizontal, or nearly
so, to the point long-axis; opposite flake scars end smoothly near
the point center line, appearing to form a continuous flake scar
across the point face.</p>
<p><i>Collateral</i>: similar to transverse flaking, except that opposite
flake scars end abruptly near the point center line, forming in
some cases a central ridge.</p>
<p><i>Oblique</i>: long, parallel flake scars are oblique or slanted in relation
to the point long-axis.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">BLANCO POINTS</span></h2>
<p>To be counted possibly among the earliest projectile point types
of the Southwest are what have been called Blanco points, named
after the Blanco River of Central Texas. They were discovered
by the writer, along with other stone and bone tools, in alluvial
banks and other formations which in part may have accumulated
during the Late Pleistocene. Lanceolate-shaped points from type
localities are characteristically desert varnished and have been
dulled and battered by being washed about in stream gravels.
Heavily weathered points quite like those of the Blanco type have
been reported in other parts of Texas and also in central and
southeast New Mexico. They have also been recovered from a
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
number of sites in Mexico and South America under circumstances
that seem to suggest great antiquity. The eminent American
archaeologist, Marie Wormington, has suggested that points
much like those of our Blanco type may well have been the basic
type from which later Early Man points evolved.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="" width="348" height="744" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Blanco</i></p>
</div>
<p>Blanco points are lanceolate-shaped and are broadest at or
somewhat below mid-section. The cross-section at this point is a
flattened oval shape. Lateral edges are
slightly rounded, converging to a point at
the tip, while the base is round. The few
known specimens range in length from
about 4.0 to 6.0 cm., in width from 2.0 to
2.5 cm., and in thickness 0.7 to 1.0 cm.
Specimens having dimensions somewhat in
excess of those listed may be expected.
Manufacture is by direct percussion and is
not particularly well achieved nor
patterned. Initial flake scars on point faces are
irregular; point bases have been thinned by
multi-directional flaking. Pressure working
of edges is absent. Due to intense weatherings,
it is not known whether Blanco points
were basally ground.</p>
<p>Blanco points are associated in central
Texas with the San Marcos Complex. They may
represent a primary Early Man projectile point type. Undisturbed
San Marcos sites have not been found as yet. Tools
ascribed to this complex have been found only in secondary
gravel beds at type localities along the Blanco River. It is conceivable
that some of these formations may have accumulated
during the Late Pleistocene. In view of all factors, dating of
Blanco points relative to other Early Man points must await
future excavations.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">SANDIA I POINTS</span></h2>
<p>This projectile point type was named after the type site, Sandia
Cave, situated at the north end of the Sandia Mountains near
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Such points have also been found
at the Lucy Site in Central New Mexico, in Central Texas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, and possibly Alabama, Alberta, and
Saskatchewan.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p01a.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="919" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sandia I</i></p>
</div>
<p>Sandia I points are lanceolate in shape and may be somewhat
asymmetrical in outline. They are distinctive in having a single
shoulder on one side of the stem. Gently
rounded lateral edges on the upper portion
taper to a point, while the rounded stem
edges taper to the somewhat narrow, rounded
base. Specimens are broadest somewhat
below mid-section and have a lenticular
cross section at this point. Both the stem
and the base have been smoothed by grinding.
Total length may vary from about 6.0
to 9.0 cm., and width from 2.0 to 4.0 cm.
Manufacture was evidently by direct
percussion and not as refined as on some later
Early Man Points. Initial flake scars on
point faces are irregular; point bases have
been thinned by multi-directional flaking.
Pressure retouch is absent.</p>
<p>Sandia I projectile points are accepted
by most archaeologists as among the oldest
documented, though not reliably dated,
point types of the Southwest and North
America in general. Similarly, the relationship
of Sandia points to Clovis and other
Early Man point types has not yet been
clearly established. That Sandia points are older than Folsom
points does remain certain, however. They may also be older than
Clovis points.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">SANDIA II POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Sandia II points were discovered together with Sandia I points
at Sandia Cave near Albuquerque, New Mexico. They differ
from Sandia I points in a number of respects.</p>
<p>Single-shouldered Sandia II points are quite similar to those
of the type Sandia I excepting details on the stem, base shape
and certain aspects of workmanship. Instead of tapering to a
rounded base, the straight-edged stem of Sandia II points contracts
to a straight or slightly concave base. Workmanship is
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
generally finer than in the other type, though achieved by the
same means. Resolved secondary edge thinning is noticeable on
many specimens. Sandia II points are also marked by vertical
basal thinning, produced by the removal of a large, or several
smaller longish flakes parallel to the point long-axis, anticipating
perhaps the fluting found on Clovis and Folsom points. Vertical
basal thinning is absent on points of the Sandia I type.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="730" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sandia II</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">SANDIA III POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Sandia III points were discovered in 1954 together with Sandia
I, Sandia II, and other Early Man points in a series of blow-outs
near Lucy, central New Mexico.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="998" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sandia III</i></p>
</div>
<p>Single-shouldered Sandia III points are similar in all respects to
Sandia II points with these exceptions: the base on specimens
of the Sandia III type is consistently deeply concave, and the
stem portion is always vertically fluted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CLOVIS POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Clovis points are named after the type site located near Clovis,
New Mexico. They were found associated with the remains of
mammoth and other extinct animal forms in gravels at the bottom
of a Late Pleistocene pond. This site
is counted among the most important
archaeological discoveries of the New
World. The series of culture layers
excavated from above the one containing
Clovis material give the most complete
sequence of Early Man cultures yet found
at a single site.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p02c.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="1452" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Clovis</i></p>
</div>
<p>Clovis points are symmetrically lanceolate
in outline and are broadest near mid-section
or sometimes nearer to the tip.
Upper lateral edges of the point body are
slightly rounded. Lower lateral edges are
commonly straight or slightly rounded
and they may taper somewhat towards the
consistently concave base. On some examples,
the lateral edges near the base
may be gently recurved. Both the basal
concavity and the lateral edges are
smoothed by intentional grinding. The
characteristic flutes were struck vertically
from only one or from both faces. In the
latter case, they may not be of equal
length. The longest flute usually does not
extend up further from the base than about
half the length of the point. Nonetheless,
specimens are known on which fluting
extends up almost the entire length of a
face. Flaking on Clovis points was probably
by direct percussion; lateral edges of
some may have been thinned by secondary
pressure retouch. Initial flake scars on
point faces are irregular. Fluting was achieved by the removal
of either one or a series of long flakes parallel to the point
long-axis, possibly by indirect percussion. Dimensions are variable.
Clovis points in the broader Southwest may range from nearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
3.5 to 14.0 cm. in length, and in width from about 2.0 to 4.0 cm.</p>
<p>Radio carbon dates and geologic evidence obtained in recent
years indicate Clovis points were in use by Early Man between
about 11,000 and 11,500 years ago in the Southwest. Though
older than Folsom points, there evidently was a period towards
the end of the Clovis sequence, during which both Clovis and
Folsom points were made and used. Clovis points have been
found with the remains of extinct Pleistocene fauna, primarily
mammoth, not only at the type locality, but at sites near Angus,
Nebraska; Dent, Colorado; Miami, Texas; and Naco, Arizona.
Finds of such points, mostly on the surface, have also been made
in northern Mexico, California, on the eastern seaboard, in the
Midwest, Canada, and Alaska.</p>
<p>Small Clovis points may be confused with Folsom points.
However, Clovis points are both thicker and heavier; flutes do
not ordinarily extend up the entire face, and workmanship is not
as fine as on Folsom points. Also, Folsom points often have a
small nipple in the middle of the basal concavity, a feature
lacking on Clovis points.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">FOLSOM POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Folsom points were first discovered in the twenties at an Early
Man kill site near Folsom, in northeast New Mexico. The points
were associated with the remains of an extinct form of giant Late
Pleistocene bison. These finds were among the
first to demonstrate the great antiquity of man
in the New World.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="664" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Folsom</i></p>
</div>
<p>Folsom points are symmetrically lanceolate in
shape, and are broadest at mid-section or
somewhat nearer to the tip. They are fluted on either
one or both faces; flutes usually extend up almost
an entire face. Upper lateral edges are
ordinarily gently rounded, while the lower
lateral edges are usually straight and either
parallel-sided or slightly contracting towards the base.
The base is consistently concave, in some
examples, markedly so. Similar to Clovis points,
stem edges near the base may be gently recurved.
Average dimensions are: length 3.0 to 8.0 cm.,
but averaging 3.0 to about 5.0 cm., and width
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
from about 1.5 to nearly 3.0 cm. Workmanship is usually quite
delicate, with initial shaping by either direct or indirect percussion
or pressure. Initial flake scars on point faces, where preserved
are irregular. Delicate secondary edge thinning was by
pressure, during which the basal concavity was probably produced
and a nipple left preparatory to fluting. Vertical fluting was
probably produced by indirect percussion.</p>
<p>The latest research suggests that Folsom points may be dated
between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago. Excavated sites producing
Folsom points have in most all cases also produced the remains
of giant bison, but not mammoth, which may have become extinct
by the advent of Folsom Man. Folsom points have been
discovered in both excavated and surface sites in most parts
of the Southwest, including the Clovis type site in eastern New
Mexico, numerous sites in most other portions of New Mexico, at the
Lubbock, Lipscomb, Scharbauer, and Kincaid Sites in Texas,
the Lindenmeier, Linger, and Powars Sites in Colorado, the Hell
Gap Site in Wyoming and the MacHaffie Site in Montana.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">HELL GAP POINTS</span></h2>
<p>This recently defined Early Man projectile point has been
named after a group of quarry sites in the Hell Cap Valley near
Guernsey in east-central Wyoming.</p>
<p>Hell Gap points, similar to many other Early Man types, are
essentially lanceolate-shaped. Upper lateral edges are slightly
rounded, while lower lateral edges taper in straight lines to the
generally narrow, slightly to noticeably rounded, occasionally
nearly straight base. These points are commonly broadest at mid-section,
but examples are known which are broadest a little below
this point. Lower lateral edges are offset from the broadest
section to such a degree that one is inclined to consider Hell
Gap points stemmed. Dimensions are: length 4.5 to 8.8 cm., and
width 2.0 to 3.0 cm. Workmanship is not nearly as fine as on
Folsom points. Flaking was produced by direct percussion, with occasional
secondary edge trimming by pressure. Initial flake scars
on point faces are irregular; basal thinning was accomplished by multi-directional
flaking. The stem and base are smoothed through
grinding; basal smoothing may be absent on some specimens.</p>
<p>Surface specimens have been found in many parts of Wyoming,
Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Similar
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
points are also known from California and parts of Texas. The
most northerly known occurrence is Alberta, in Canada.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<p class="pcap"><i>Hell Gap</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">MIDLAND POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Midland points were first discovered at the Scharbauer Site
near Midland, in West Texas. They were evidently contemporaneous
with Folsom points, which they greatly resemble.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p04b.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Midland</i></p>
</div>
<p>Formal description of Midland points has not yet been made.
They are mentioned, however, as appearing a great deal like Folsom
points in shape, size, and thinness, but are distinct from them
in not being fluted. Otherwise they are apparently of the same
fine workmanship and technological tradition as Folsom points.</p>
<p>Deposits in which a Midland point fragment was found with
human remains at the Scharbauer Site have been dated to about
11,000 years ago, indicating a time range for this point type
corresponding to that of Folsom. Similar points have been found
near Lubbock, Texas; central New Mexico; and as far east as
San Augustine County, Texas. Possibly they will be found to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
occur in other districts on or near the Llano Estacado. Quite frequently
they are found together with Folsom points in west
Texas and New Mexico localities.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">PLAINVIEW POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Plainview points were first defined on the basis of type specimens
recovered from a bison kill site near Plainview in the Texas
Panhandle.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p04c.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="883" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Plainview</i></p>
</div>
<p>Lanceolate shaped, the upper lateral edges of the most Plainview
points are slightly rounded but on some they are straight.
Lower lateral edges are ordinarily straight
and parallel-sided up to about one-half or
three-quarters the distance from the base to
the tip. They are usually broadest at mid-section.
A variation in shape may include a
recurve, rarely marked, of lateral edges near
the base; such specimens are broadest either
at or somewhat above the mid-section (see
also the description of <a href="#c20">Golondrina points</a>).
The base of Plainview points varies from
slightly to markedly concave; the former is
typical. Workmanship is quite fine. Direct
or indirect percussion or possibly pressure action
is employed in retouching. Initial flake
scars may be at either right angles or slightly
oblique to the point long-axis. Though individual
initial flake scars may be parallel,
they are more often irregular. Dimensions of
Plainview points are: length about 4.5 to 8.0
cm., width 1.8 to 2.8 cm. Bases of these points
were sometimes thinned by the removal of
the series of relatively large, longish flakes parallel to the point
long-axis in a technique reminiscent of fluting. Others however,
were basally thinned by the removal of flakes from the lower
lateral edges at right angles to the point long-axis. Basal edges
are usually smoothed.</p>
<p>Plainview points are considered by most archaeologists to date
around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago. At both the type site and at
the Lone Wolf Creek Site in Texas, they were associated with
the remains of extinct bison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">MILNESAND POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Milnesand points were first recorded at a site near Milnesand,
New Mexico.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="912" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Milnesand</i></p>
</div>
<p>Lanceolate in shape, Milnesand points are broadest either at
mid-section or somewhat above. Upper lateral edges are slightly
to markedly rounded, while the lower edges are straight and
taper a little towards the typically straight
base. Bases on some may be slightly
rounded or concave. Average dimensions
are: length 5.0 to 8.0 cm., width 2.0 to
nearly 3.0 cm. Workmanship is generally
quite fine, and has been achieved with
either direct or indirect percussion, or possibly
pressure. Secondary thinning of both
lateral and basal edges often occurs and is
by pressure. Initial flaking of point faces is
patterned: transverse flake scars are approximately
parallel to one another and at
right angles to the point long-axis. These
scars terminate at the point mid-line; some
specimens may have a distinct median
ridge on one or both faces. Horizontal
basal thinning, accomplished primarily
during initial flaking may be accompanied
by the removal of small flakes vertical to
the point long-axis. Both the lower lateral
edges and base are carefully smoothed.</p>
<p>Milnesand points at the type site were
found with the remains of bison, possibly an extinct form. They
occur widely in eastern New Mexico and western Texas. Others
have been found in Nebraska, Iowa, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Alaska. Similarities of Milnesand to Plainview points have been
noted by archaeologists, who have suggested the two may be related
and probably were partly contemporaneous. They may be
distinguished from one another by the following attributes: The
base on most Milnesand points is straight, while it is predominantly
concave on Plainviews; thinning of Plainview bases was
accomplished primarily by the removing of a few, fairly large
vertical flakes, while Milnesand bases were thinned primarily by
the removal of horizontal flakes, and only secondarily by the removal
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
of small flakes. Finally, the smoothing of lower lateral
edges on Milnesand points generally extends up further than on
Plainview points, sometimes to a point beyond the mid-section.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">MESERVE POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Meserve points were first described from the Meserve Site near
Grand Island, Nebraska. They are found in most parts of the
Southwest.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="976" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Meserve</i></p>
</div>
<p>Meserve points are basically lanceolate-shaped. Upper lateral
edges, which in the case of these points comprise almost three-quarters
of the total point length, are typically straight. They are
quite distinctive in being rather steeply alternately
bevelled and they may be serrated. Bevelling
is always on the right edge when viewed
with the point tip forward; cross-section of the
upper lateral edges at mid-section is rhomboidal.
The unusually short lower lateral edges
are straight or slightly concave. Meserve points
are broadest either at the distal end of these
edges, or at the base. The base is shallowly or
markedly concave. Basal thinning is accomplished
mainly by the removal of either one
large flake or several narrower flakes parallel
to the point long-axis, in a fashion reminiscent
of the thinning of Plainview point bases. Less
often, these scars are small and numerous.
Thinning in some cases was by the removal of
flakes at right angles to the point long-axis during
initial retouch of the point faces. Average
dimensions are: length 3.0 to 9.0 cm., width
(base) 2.0 to 2.7 cm. Workmanship is generally
good. Initial shaping as well as bevelling
were likely by direct percussion. Initial flake
scars are usually irregular. Basal thinning in
some cases was probably by indirect percussion. Lateral edges
may be secondarily pressure retouched. Smoothing is observed
on both the lower non-bevelled lateral edges and in the concave
base.</p>
<p>An estimated age of from 9,000 to 5,000 or even 4,000 years
ago has been suggested for Meserve points. They are thus in part
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
contemporaneous with, and have been found with, Plainview
points. Meserve points are found throughout most of the Southwest,
as far north as Canada, and in the Midwest states. They appear
to be most common on the Llano Estacado.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Eden</i></p>
</div>
<p>Projectile points of the type Scottsbluff were first defined on
the basis of specimens recovered from a bison kill site near Scottsbluff,
Nebraska.</p>
<p>The over-all shape of Scottsbluff I points is either lanceolate
or triangular. Upper lateral edges are usually straight, but they
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
may be faintly rounded. Characteristic of this type is a broad
stem and faint shoulders. Parallel edges of the stem are straight;
sometimes they may expand towards the base. The small shoulders,
the widest part of these points, are cut inwards at right
angles to the point long-axis. The stem base is straight or slightly
rounded, very rarely slightly concave. Average dimensions range
from about 5.0 to 15.0 cm. in length; width at the shoulders is
from 2.4 to 3.5 cm., and width at the stem base 2.0 to 3.0 cm.
Workmanship on most Scottsbluff I points is well executed.
Initial shaping was carried out by direct or indirect percussion.
Typical of many Scottsbluff I points are the longish parallel
flake scars produced during this stage of retouch. They are at
right angles to the point long-axis and are of the transverse type.
On others patterning of flake scars is more irregular. Lateral
edges of some may be secondarily pressure retouched. Both the
stem lateral edges and base are smoothed.</p>
<p>Scottsbluff I points have a suggested age range of from 9,500
to about 7,000 years. They are known to occur not only in
Nebraska, but in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Washington, and in
Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">SCOTTSBLUFF II POINTS</span></h2>
<p>These points are probably of the same age and distribution as
those of the Scottsbluff I type.</p>
<p>Scottsbluff II points are morphologically quite similar to those
of the Scottsbluff I type with these exceptions: the lateral edges
of the point body on Scottsbluff II points are straight, giving this
portion of the point a definitely triangular outline; in addition,
the point body is relatively broader at the shoulders, and the
shoulders are more markedly offset from the stem than on Scottsbluff
I points. Also, the former are generally shorter and thinner
than those of the latter type.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">EDEN POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Eden points bear a great deal of resemblance to Scottsbluff
points, with which they are sometimes found. Dissimilarities are
pointed out below.</p>
<p>Eden points, though of the same basic shape, are much narrower
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
in relation to over-all length than are Scottsbluff points.
Most commonly, shoulders on Eden points are very faint indeed.
Transverse facial flaking is much like that on Scottsbluff points.
More frequently it is of the collateral type.</p>
<p>Probably the same age as the Scottsbluff type.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">BROWNS VALLEY POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Browns Valley points were initially discovered at a site near
Browns Valley, Minnesota. They were associated with a human
burial.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="pcap"><i>Browns Valley</i></p>

<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p07a.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="1126" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Agate Basin</i></p>
</div>
<p>Browns Valley points are broad lanceolate in shape. Upper
lateral edges are slightly rounded. Lower lateral edges are much
less rounded, contracting very slightly to either a shallowly concave
or straight base. These points are broadest at mid-section.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Dimensions are: length 7.0 to 8.0 cm., width 3.0 cm. (full range
indeterminate since few specimens known). Workmanship is fine.
Initial shaping may have been by direct or indirect percussion.
The initial flake scars are parallel and run obliquely across the
point faces; less often they are at right angles. Bases have been
initially thinned by the removal of a series of small longish flakes
mainly oblique to the point long-axis, to a lesser extent by the removal
of vertical flakes. Basal edges are smoothed.</p>
<p>Browns Valley points are rare and have an estimated age of
from 9,000 to 8,000 years. Similar points excavated in Wyoming
have a comparable age of almost 8,000 years.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">AGATE BASIN POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Agate Basin points were first recognized at a bison kill site between
Newcastle and Lusk in eastern Wyoming. The bison were
probably of a recent type, but this is not certain.</p>
<p>Agate Basin points are slender lanceolate in shape. Both the
upper and lower lateral edges are gently rounded. Lower lateral
edges on some, however, may be nearly straight and contracting
slightly to the base. They are usually broadest above mid-section.
The base is either straight or rounded, although on some specimens
it may be bluntly pointed. Length varies from 6.0 to 15.0
cm., width from 2.0 to about 3.0 cm. Workmanship is quite fine.
Initial shaping was by direct or indirect percussion. Flake scars
are consistently sub-parallel and at right angles to the point long-axis.
Thinning of lateral edges was by pressure retouch. Lower
lateral edges are smoothed, the base rarely so. Basal thinning was
achieved during initial retouch and is at right angles to the
point long-axis.</p>
<p>Although the age range of Agate Basin points is uncertain,
it is probable that they belong to a later stage of the Early Man
point sequence.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">GOLONDRINA POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Golondrina points were defined on the basis of specimens
found at the Devils River Site on the Rio Grande in southwest
Texas.</p>
<p>Golondrina points are of broad lanceolate shape. Upper lateral
edges are usually markedly rounded. Lower lateral edges
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
are characteristically recurved, resulting
in out-flaring basal corners of ears. The
base is quite deeply concave. The broadest
part is at mid-section or a little beyond,
towards the tip. Average dimensions
are: length 6.0 to 8.0 cm., maximum
body width 2.3 to 3.2 cm., and
base width 2.2 to 2.9 cm. Workmanship
is fine. Initial and secondary shaping
and thinning was by direct percussion.
Initial flake scars are irregular. Pressure
retouch of edges is not obvious. Essentially,
vertical basal thinning was accomplished
by the removal of either one or
a series of irregular flakes. It should be
noted that thinning scars on occasional
specimens may be quite narrow and parallel
to the point long-axis. Both the
lower lateral edges and the basal concavity
have been smoothed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="868" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Golondrina</i></p>
</div>
<p>At the type site, Golondrina points
have been dated to about 8,000 years ago. Plainview points may
be associated with them. Golondrina points have been found in
north central, central, and southwest Texas and northeast Mexico.
It is likely they will be identified in other parts of the
broader Southwest.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">GYPSUM CAVE POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Gypsum Cave points were discovered together with the remains
of extinct ground sloth in a cave near Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>The over-all shape of Gypsum Cave points is elongate triangular.
The straight upper lateral edges comprise virtually the
entire length of specimens. The lower portion is characterized
by a short stem formed by the abrupt sloping back of base edges
from marked shoulders; the base is rounded. They are broadest
from shoulder to shoulder. Average length of Gypsum Cave
points is 5.0 to about 6.5 cm., and width about 3.0 cm. Flaking
seems to have been produced by direct percussion. Initial flake
scars are irregular. Secondary thinning of lateral edges is apparently
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
absent. Stem edges were produced by multi-directional flaking.
They are not smoothed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="870" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Gypsum Cave</i></p>
</div>
<p>The estimated age of Gypsum Cave points at the type site is
from about 8,000 to 10,000 years. Points similar to these were
found in a cave in the Manzano Mountains near Albuquerque
and south of the Sandias. A specimen was recovered from the
Lindenmeier Site in Colorado above the Folsom layer.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">LAKE MOHAVE POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Lake Mohave points were originally described from the Lake
Mohave district of southeastern California. They were recovered
from the surface and from ancient fossil beaches and terraces.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p08b.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="788" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Lake Mohave</i></p>
</div>
<p>Lake Mohave points are slender lanceolate in shape with the
broadest part above mid-section, about three-quarters up from the
base. The upper lateral edges are slightly rounded. The over-all
impression one has of these lower edges is that of a long tapering
stem. Lake Mohave points may be faintly shouldered. Average
dimensions are: length about 4.0 to 7.5 cm., width at the broadest
part 2.5 to 3.0 cm. Workmanship, though well-achieved, is
characterized by irregular initial flake scars, probably produced
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
by direct percussion. Basal thinning was achieved by multi-directional
flaking.</p>
<p>The estimated age range of Lake Mohave points is from about
7,000 to 9,000 years. It is probable this point type is related to
similar types of the Southwest.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">RIO GRANDE POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Rio Grande points were first defined in 1942 on the basis of
surface collections of lithic artifacts from the Upper Rio Grande
Valley.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="794" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Rio Grande</i></p>
</div>
<p>Rio Grande points are basically lanceolate in shape. Upper
lateral edges are straight to gently rounded. They are broadest
slightly above mid-section. Lower lateral edges are set off from
the upper portion of the point body by very
small shoulders, so that this point must be
considered stemmed. Stem edges are consistently
straight and taper slightly to the
base. The base is usually straight, less often
it is slightly rounded or shallowly concave.
Average dimensions are: length 6.0
cm., shoulder width 2.8 cm., base width 1.8 cm.
Some larger specimens are known. Manufacture
is by direct percussion. Initial flake
scars on point faces are irregular. Basal
thinning was accomplished in the main by
multi-directional flaking. Stem edges may
show secondary percussion or pressure retouch.
Stem edges are well smoothed; the
base may be slightly smoothed or not at all.</p>
<p>The age of Rio Grande points has not
been definitely established nor have associations
with other early point types been
ascertained. They appear to be related to the Hell Gap and
Lake Mohave types.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">ESCOBAS POINTS</span></h2>
<p>Escobas points, newly defined in this guide, were to all appearances
first discovered and described at Pecos Pueblo, southeast of
Santa Fe, New Mexico. Specimens excavated there evidently
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
were collected by inhabitants of the pueblos from
nearby sites pre-dating the pueblo. This point
type is named after Escobas Peak, near Pecos.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="774" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Escobas</i></p>
</div>
<p>Escobas points are lanceolate shaped and are
consistently broadest immediately below mid-section.
Upper lateral edges are usually straight,
but they may be slightly rounded. Lower lateral
edges are set off from the upper portion of the
point body by very slight shoulders, so that this
point must be considered as stemmed. Parallel
to slightly expanding, stem edges are characteristically
faintly concave between the shoulders
and base edges. The base is always distinctly
concave. Average dimensions: length 6.0
cm., shoulder width 2.0 cm., base width 1.7 cm.
Workmanship is not refined. Initial flaking of
point faces has been achieved by direct percussion;
flake scars are irregular. Stem edges may
show slight secondary retouch by either percussion
or pressure. Basal thinning was accomplished primarily
by the striking of irregular flakes from the basal concavity, to a
lesser extent by removal of horizontal flakes from the base. Stem
edges are well smoothed; the concave base is either slightly
smoothed or not at all.</p>
<p>The relation of Escobas points to other Early Man points has
not yet been determined. They do, however, resemble some other
early types. Escobas points are broadly similar to Rio Grande
points in shape, but they differ from them in the following respects:
parallel to slightly expanding stem edges of Escobas points
are consistently slightly concave between the shoulders and base,
while stem edges on Rio Grande points are always straight and
taper somewhat to the base. Escobas point stems are shorter,
relative to overall point length than Rio Grande stems. Shoulders
on Escobas are much fainter than on Rio Grande points; bases of
Escobas points are, so far as known, always concave, whereas they
are only occasionally so on Rio Grande points. Both, however,
share the attribute of being well-smoothed on stem edges, and are
either slightly smoothed or not at all on basal edges. Escobas
points occur in the Pecos district, the Upper Rio Grande Valley,
and, according to Stewart Peckham (personal communication),
in the San Juan Basin of northwest New Mexico. They will
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
likely be found to occur in other parts of the Southwest, in some
areas in association with points of the Rio Grande type.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
